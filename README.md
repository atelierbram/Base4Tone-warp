# Base4Tone for Warp

## Manual install
Download or clone this repo and put it in the `~/.warp/themes/` folder of [your favorite terminal emulator](https://docs.warp.dev/).
The new themes should now be visible on the list of available themes within Warp.

## Base4Tone
More information on these colorschemes can be found at [atelierbram.github.io/syntax-highlighting/base4tone](https://atelierbram.github.io/syntax-highlighting/base4tone)

## Templating
A simple templating system with variables in PHP (with Curl) is used for generating the files. For the curious: those can be found in de `db` folder.
